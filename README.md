# Music Millenium Classification
![](https://github.com/saihiel/Music_Year_Classification/blob/master/million_song_dataset.jpg)  
I will build Logistic Regression and K - Nearest Neighbour models to predict which century a piece of music was released. I am using the "YearPredictionMSD Data Set" based on the Million Song Dataset. The data is available to download from the UCI Machine Learning Repository:

*As this is not as challenging a dataset/project I will make it more interesting by implementing my Logistic Regression models using only numpy and train it using stochastic gradient descent from scratch. I will similarly implement my K-NN model from scratch!*

## Results
The accuracies achieved by my Logistic Regression model:  
  Training:  72.17%  
  Validation:  72.49%  
  **Test:  71.32%**  
  
The K-Nearest Neighbours model does not perform as well:  
  Validation Accuracy for k=100:  70.4%  
  Test Accuracy for k=100: 55.%
